# Impedance Control Benchmark
Welcome to the Impedance Control Benchmark project. This project is dedicated to characterizing impedance control methods in robotics. 

The primary focus is on proposing a Python-based toolset that relies on the Pinocchio rigid body dynamics library (Python wrappers), Numpy, and Matplotlib. 
The aim is to increase the reachability using this programming language without losing the theoretical background.

## Installation and Dependencies

The source code was developed with the following libraries and their respective versions:

1. Python 3.10
2. [Pinocchio](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html#Install_1) 2.6.20
3. Matplotlib 3.6.2
4. Numpy 1.23.5

Versions are strongly recommended, but not strictly. Following, clone this repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:leggedrobotics-usp/impedance_control_benchmark.git
```
This is it!
