## Symbolic math scripts for the analysis and derivation of the Impedance Ellipse

The file in this directory is a Matlab script in which the 2nd-order impedance model is analyzed, and the elliptical curve on the impedance space is derived.
The impedance space is defined by 3 dimensions: the position deviation, the velocity (position derivative) deviation, and the input force. Plots are shown 
for both time and frequency domain sets of parameters. Stiffness, damping, and mass parameters are the time domain set. Stiffness, damping factor, and 
natural frequency are the frequency domain set.
