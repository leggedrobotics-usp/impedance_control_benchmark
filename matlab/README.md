## Symbolic math scripts for the impedance ellipse analysis and derivation

This Matlab script contains the 2nd-order impedance model analysis under sinusoidal input, and the dynamic elliptical 
curve related with impedance model parameters. The elliptical curve is at the so called impedance space defined by the
position deviation, the velocity deviation, and the input force. Plots are shown for both time and frequency domain 
parameter sets. On the time domain set are stiffness, damping, and mass. On the frequency domain set are stiffness,
damping factor, and natural frequency.
